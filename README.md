To run this program it needs to first be compiled.

Ex) gcc mywc.c -o mywc

Then it can be run by feeding it a text file like so: ./mywc < hello.txt.


The program will then print out to the console:

1 line(s)  10 word(s)  44 character(s) in the case of the provided hello.txt. It gets 44 characters by counting the all of the letters in the statement along with spaces, punctuation marks, tabs, newlines, etc.
